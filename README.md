# 🏙️ Urban Symphony: Mohakhali Bus Terminal Simulation

This project is a **Computer Graphics** simulation of **Mohakhali Bus Terminal**, one of Dhaka’s busiest transport hubs.  
It uses **C++ with OpenGL (GLUT)** to create an animated and interactive city scene.

## 📖 Project Description
This simulation displays:
- Multiple **bus counters** with signboards for popular transport services (Hanif, Ena, Shohag, Green Line, National Travels, Grameen, Desh).
- **Buses parked** at counters and **waiting sheds** for passengers.
- **Main terminal building** labeled “Mohakhali Bus Terminal.”
- **Animated vehicles** – buses, cars, trucks, and CNGs move along the highway with **rotating wheels**.
- **BRTC bus** that stops in front of the terminal for 3 seconds and resumes.
- **Train running** on the railway track at the bottom of the screen.
- **Airplane flying** in the sky.
- **Natural environment** with sun, moon, clouds, and trees, with day, night, evening, cloudy, rainy, snow, and fog modes.
